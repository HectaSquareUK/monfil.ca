# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan and features for a modern chat application with a smart reply feature, built with Next.js and Firebase.

## Implemented Features

*   **Initial Project Setup:** A standard Next.js project with the App Router.

## Current Plan: Build a Chat Interface with Smart Replies

### 1. Create `blueprint.md`

*   (Completed) Create this file to document the project's plan and features.

### 2. Build the Basic Chat UI

*   Create React components for a chat window, including:
    *   Message bubbles for incoming and outgoing messages.
    *   A text input area for composing messages.
    *   A send button.

### 3. Implement the Smart Reply Feature

*   Add a section below the chat input to display suggested replies.
*   Initially, these will be hardcoded, but can be replaced with a dynamic smart reply service later.

### 4. Style the Components

*   Apply modern and visually appealing styles to all UI components.
*   Ensure the chat interface is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
