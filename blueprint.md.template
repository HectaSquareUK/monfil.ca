# Project Blueprint

## AI Development Guidelines

These guidelines define the operational principles and capabilities of the AI agent interacting with this Next.js project.

### Environment & Context Awareness

*   **Project Structure (App Router):** The AI assumes a standard Next.js project structure using the App Router.
*   **`dev.nix` Configuration:** The AI is aware of the `.idx/dev.nix` file for environment configuration.
*   **Preview Server:** The AI will not run `next dev` but will monitor the output of the already running preview server.

### Code Modification & Dependency Management

*   **Core Code Assumption:** The AI will primarily work with React components (`.tsx` or `.jsx`).
*   **Package Management:** The AI will use `npm` for package management.
*   **Next.js CLI:** The AI will use `npm run build` and `npm run lint`.

### Next.js Core Concepts (App Router)

*   **Server Components by Default:** Data fetching will be done directly in Server Components.
*   **`"use client"` Directive:** For components that require interactivity, state, or browser-only APIs.
*   **File-based Routing:** Routing is managed by creating folders and `page.tsx` files.
*   **Server Actions:** For data mutations, the AI will use Server Actions with the `"use server"` directive.

### Automated Error Detection & Remediation

*   **Post-Modification Checks:** After every code modification, the AI will run `npm run lint -- --fix` and monitor the IDE's diagnostics and dev server output.
*   **Automatic Error Correction:** The AI will attempt to fix common Next.js and React errors.

### Visual Design & Accessibility

*   **Aesthetics:** The AI will create modern, visually balanced, and intuitive user interfaces.
*   **Responsiveness:** The app will be mobile-responsive.
*   **A11Y Standards:** The AI will implement accessibility features.

### Iterative Development & User Interaction

*   **Blueprint Management:** The AI will create and maintain this `blueprint.md` file, documenting the project overview, features, and current development plan.
*   **Prompt Understanding:** The AI will interpret user prompts and ask for clarification when needed.
*   **Contextual Responses:** The AI will provide conversational responses, explaining its actions and progress.

## Overview

This is a Next.js application with a modern, responsive layout. It features a custom header with a search bar and a call-to-action button.

## Project Structure

- **/app** - The main application directory.
  - **layout.tsx** - The root layout, which includes the header and main content area.
  - **page.tsx** - The main page of the application.
- **/components** - Reusable React components.
  - **header.tsx** - The main header component.
  - **/ui** - UI components from shadcn.
    - **button.tsx**
    - **input.tsx**
- **/public** - Static assets.
- **package.json** - Project dependencies and scripts.
- **tailwind.config.ts** - Tailwind CSS configuration.

## Current Change: Fancy Header

- **Objective:** Create a modern, visually appealing header with a search bar and a "Get Started" button.
- **Steps Taken:**
  1. Installed `shadcn` and its dependencies.
  2. Resolved a persistent build issue related to `tailwindcss-animate` by:
     - Correcting `tailwind.config.ts`.
     - Resetting `node_modules` and reinstalling dependencies.
     - Removing a conflicting `@import` statement from `globals.css`.
  3. Added `button` and `input` components from `shadcn`.
  4. Created a new `Header` component (`components/header.tsx`).
  5. Integrated the `Header` into the main application layout (`app/layout.tsx`).
  6. Created this blueprint to document the project.
